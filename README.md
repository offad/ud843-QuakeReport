## Earthquake Report App
===================================

Used in a Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree.

Based on the QuakeReport Project from the [Android Basics: Networking](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud843) section of the Android Basics Course.

## Description 

The original QuakeReportapp displays a list of recent earthquakes in the world from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) organization. However, while I lived in Nigeria, I wanted an app that fetched data concerning Africa. Hence, this fork makes requests for the African region.

More info on the USGS Earthquake API available at: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

## Evaluation
+ Using asynchronous tasks and loaders to connect to the internet.
+ Making custom API calls to fetch certain aspects of data.
+ Reading and parsing JSON data.
+ Customizing AdapterViews, such as LIstViews, using ArrayAdapters.
+ Designing better UX, such as using progress bar to show progression and empty ListView fragments to represent empty fetched data.
