# Earthquake Report App
===================================

This app displays a list of recent earthquakes in certain areas of Africa from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) organization.

Based on a Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree for [Android Basics: Networking.](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud843)

## Description 
The original app polls earthquake for earthquakes all around the world. However, while I lived in Nigeria, I wanted to make an earthquake app  that focused on certain areas of 
Africa. Hence, this app displays a list of recent earthquakes in certain areas of Africa from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) organization.

## Evaluation
+ Using asynchronous tasks and loaders to connect to the internet.
+ Making calls to online API services
+ Reading and parsing JSON data fetched from such API services.
+ Customising AdapterViews, such as ListViews, using ArrayAdapters.
+ Creating better UX through showing progression with a progress bar and signifies for empty queries on the ListView.
